# Simulations
The purpose of this repository is to share any source code that contributed to a research article.
The language used is Java. One possibility to replicate the simulations is the following:
- download the source code,
- go to the `src` folder,
- execute `javac <package-name>/*.java` to compile,
- and then `java <package-name>.Main` to run.
Modifying the `Main.java` file allows one to change the parameters of the simulation.
Figures that appears in the articles are drawn separately with Python **matplotlib**, whose code is not provided here.

Below is a list of available packages and the article they are associated with.
- `pull_model`: "_On the Role of Memory in Robust Opinion Dynamics_".
